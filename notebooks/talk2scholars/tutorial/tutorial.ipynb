Both approaches showed promising results in the analysis and optimization of healthcare processes. Therefore, the combination of simulation models and AI could provide a strategy to further boost the quality of health services. In this work, a systematic review of studies applying a hybrid simulation models and AI approach to address healthcare management challenges was carried out. Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were screened by independent reviewers. The main strategies to combine simulation and AI as well as the major healthcare application scenarios were identified and discussed. Moreover, tools and algorithms to implement the proposed approaches were described. Results showed that machine learning appears to be the most employed AI strategy in combination with simulation models, which mainly rely on agent-based and discrete-event systems. The scarcity and heterogeneity of the included studies suggested that a standardized framework to implement hybrid machine learning-simulation approaches in healthcare management is yet to be defined.

Due to better performance and rapid development in the last decade, quantum computing is also benefiting many areas.

Healthcare is one of the prominent domains where a huge volume of data is produced from several processes. Efficient processing of healthcare data and records is very important to facilitate many biological and medical processes to provide better treatments to patients. The fundamental aim of this paper is to present a state-of-the-art review of quantum computing concepts, quantum machine learning framework, and the various applications of quantum machine learning in the domain of healthcare.
