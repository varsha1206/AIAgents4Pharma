### General questions about the model


**Q:** Describe the model <br>

```

Briefly describe the BioModel 971
```
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The BioModel 971, named "Tang2020 - Estimation of transmission risk of COVID-19 and impact of public health interventions," focuses on the rapid spread of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) since its emergence in Wuhan, China. It utilizes a deterministic compartmental model to estimate the basic reproduction number, which is crucial for understanding the potential severity of the outbreak and guiding disease intervention strategies.

The model indicates that the control reproduction number could be as high as 6.47, and sensitivity analyses suggest that interventions like intensive contact tracing, quarantine, and isolation can significantly reduce transmission risk. The study highlights the effectiveness of travel restrictions implemented by Chinese authorities, showing that such measures can lead to a substantial decrease in the number of infected individuals. Under strict measures, the outbreak is expected to peak within two weeks, with a notable reduction in cases due to travel restrictions.

<summary>Answer</summary>

The components of BioModel 971 include:
<h3>Species:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Susceptible:</strong> Individuals who are at risk of contracting the virus.</li>
  <li><strong>Exposed:</strong> Individuals who have been exposed to the virus but are not yet infectious.</li>
  <li><strong>Infected:</strong> Individuals who are currently infected and can transmit the virus.</li>
  <li><strong>Asymptomatic:</strong> Infected individuals who do not show symptoms but can still spread the virus.</li>
  <li><strong>Susceptible_quarantined:</strong> Susceptible individuals who are in quarantine.</li>
  <li><strong>Exposed_quarantined:</strong> Exposed individuals who are in quarantine.</li>
  <li><strong>Hospitalised:</strong> Individuals who are hospitalized due to severe infection.</li>
  <li><strong>Recovered:</strong> Individuals who have recovered from the infection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parameters:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>c:</strong> Contact rate.</li>
  <li><strong>beta:</strong> Transmission probability per contact.</li>
  <li><strong>q:</strong> Quarantine rate.</li>

**Q:** Set the quarantine rate (`q_lockdown`) 20 times the initial value (=3.7774 e-06) and simulate the model (reproduce the red line in figure 3C from the paper). <br>



```
Simulate the model again, but set the parameter 'q_lockdown' to 0.0000037774. Call this model_high_lockdown.

**Q:** Compare infected cases for both simulations. <br>

```
What is the value of infected cases at the end of the simulation in both experiments?
```

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

The values of infected cases at the end of the simulations are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>For the experiment model_default, the value is approximately <strong>104,338.52</strong></li>
  <li>For the experiment model_high_lockdown, the value is approximately <strong>7,275.49</strong></li>
</ul>
