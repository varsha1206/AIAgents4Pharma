#### 4. How do I run a simulation on a model?
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Use the `Simulate_model` tool to simulate a model. You can specify duration, time intervals, and initial values for species/parameters.
  <br>
  - Basic simulation:
    ```
    Simulate model 64
    ```
  - Specify simulation time and interval:
    ```
    Simulate model 64 for 3 days with an interval of 10
    ```
  - Set initial concentration and add recurring events:
    ```
    Run a simulation on model 537 for 100 hours with a time interval of 50.
    Set the initial concentration of Ab{serum} to 100.
    Add a recurring event that resets Ab{serum} to 100 every 20 hours.
    ```
</details>

#### 5. Can I create custom plots from my simulation results?
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  The `Custom_plotter` tool helps you focus on a subset of species in a simulation plot.
  <br>
  - Plot only CRP-related species:
    ```
    Make a custom plot to show only CRP-related species.
    ```
  - Plot glucose-related species:
    ```
    Plot only glucose-related species.
    ```
</details>

#### 6. How do I bring a model to steady state?
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  The `Steady_state` tool helps stabilize a model.
  <br>
  - Basic steady-state analysis:
    ```
    Bring model 64 to a steady state
    ```
  - Set initial conditions before analysis:
    ```
    Bring model 64 to a steady state. Set the initial concentration of Pyruvate to 50.
    ```
</details>

#### 7. How do I ask questions about the simulation results?
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  Use the `Ask_question` tool after running a simulation or steady-state analysis to retrieve insights.
  <br>
  - Steady-state concentration of a species:
    ```
    What is the steady-state concentration of Pyruvate?
    ```
  - Time required for a species to reach steady state:
    ```
    How long does glucose-related species take to reach steady state?
    ```
  - Final concentration in a simulation:
    ```
    What is the concentration of CRP-related species at the end of the simulation?
    ```
</details>

#### 8. How do I analyze how one species or parameter affects another?
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  The `Parameter_scan` tool allows you to analyze how changes in one parameter affect another.
  <br>
  - Effect of extracellular glucose on Pyruvate:
    ```
    How does the value of Pyruvate change in model 64 if the concentration of Extracellular Glucose is changed from 10 to 100 with a step size of 10? The simulation should run for 5 time units with an interval of 10.
    ```
  - Effect of dose changes on CRP concentration:
    ```
    Run a param scan in model 537 to observe change in concentration of CRP in serum over time if initial value of the parameter Dose is changed from 100 to 500 with a step size of 25.
    ```
</details>

#### 9. Can I ask questions about a research article I uploaded?
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  The `Query_article` tool helps analyze uploaded research articles.
  <br>
  - Summarize key takeaways:
    ```
    What are the key takeaways of the uploaded article?
    ```
  - Find parameter descriptions in the article:
    ```
