Medical professionals are acquiring enhanced diagnostic and treatment abilities by utilizing machine learning applications in the healthcare domain. Medical data have been used by many researchers to detect diseases and identify patterns. In the current literature, there are very few studies that address machine learning algorithms to improve healthcare data accuracy and efficiency. We examined the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in improving time series healthcare metrics for heart rate data transmission (accuracy and efficiency). In this paper, we reviewed several machine learning algorithms in healthcare applications. After a comprehensive overview and investigation of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, we also demonstrated time series tasks based on past values (along with reviewing their feasibility for both small and large datasets). |                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                      | Simulation models and artificial intelligence (AI) are largely used to address healthcare and biomedical engineering problems. Both approaches showed promising results in the analysis and optimization of healthcare processes. Therefore, the combination of simulation models and AI could provide a strategy to further boost the quality of health services. In this work, a systematic review of studies applying a hybrid simulation models and AI approach to address healthcare management challenges was carried out. Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed databases were screened by independent reviewers. The main strategies to combine simulation and AI as well as the major healthcare application scenarios were identified and discussed. Moreover, tools and algorithms to implement the proposed approaches were described. Results showed that machine learning appears to be the most employed AI strategy in combination with simulation models, which mainly rely on agent-based and discrete-event systems. The scarcity and heterogeneity of the included studies suggested that a standardized framework to implement hybrid machine learning-simulation approaches in healthcare management is yet to be defined. Future efforts should aim to use these approaches to design novel intelligent in-silico models of healthcare processes and to provide effective translation to the clinics. |

Abstract       | Recently, a range of advanced techniques, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, have been used to analyse health-related data. Machine learning applications are helping medical practitioners become more proficient in diagnosing and treating patients. Numerous academics have used medical data to find trends and diagnose illnesses. There aren't many papers in the literature right now that discuss using machine learning algorithms to increase the efficiency and accuracy of healthcare data. We investigated how well time series healthcare parameters for heart rate data transfer (accuracy and efficiency) may be enhanced using machine learning methods. We explored a number of machine learning techniques for use in healthcare applications in this research. Following a thorough introduction and analysis of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. | The global need for effective disease diagnosis remains substantial, given the complexities of various disease mechanisms and diverse patient symptoms. To tackle these challenges, researchers, physicians, and patients are turning to machine learning (ML), an artificial intelligence (AI) discipline, to develop solutions. By leveraging sophisticated ML and AI methods, healthcare stakeholders gain enhanced diagnostic and treatment capabilities. However, there is a scarcity of research focused on ML algorithms for enhancing the accuracy and computational efficiency. This research investigates the capacity of machine learning algorithms to improve the transmission of heart rate data in time series healthcare metrics, concentrating particularly on optimizing accuracy and efficiency. By exploring various ML algorithms used in healthcare applications, the review presents the latest trends and approaches in ML-based disease diagnosis (MLBDD). The factors under consideration include the algorithm utilized, the types of diseases targeted, the data types employed, the applications, and the evaluation metrics. This review aims to shed light on the prospects of ML in healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis. By analyzing the current literature, the study provides insights into state-of-the-art methodologies and their performance metrics. | Traditional research techniques do not work well in the dynamic environment of big data in the healthcare industry, which is characterized by enormous numbers, complexity, and speeds.
