"""
Tool for rendering the most recently displayed papers as a DataFrame artifact for the front-end.

This module defines a tool that retrieves the paper metadata stored under the state key
'last_displayed_papers' and returns it as an artifact (dictionary of papers). The front-end
can then render this artifact as a pandas DataFrame for display. If no papers are found,
a NoPapersFoundError is raised to indicate that a search or recommendation should be
performed first.

    Render the last set of retrieved papers as a DataFrame in the front-end.
